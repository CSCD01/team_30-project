Comments:

I was happy to see that the team is on the same page and collaborating
well. I suggest you put more effort into preparing for the second
interview, so that it looks and sounds more professional.

The team introduction was done well, in a professional manner. 

The reasons for selecting the project were waived in your case.

The project was introduced well. I suggest you prepare a more advanced
demonstration for the second interview.

You presented convincing arguments for choosing the software process.

As we have discussed, there are details missing in the software
process. I would be happy to replace this part of the interview grade
with what you achieve in the second interview.
